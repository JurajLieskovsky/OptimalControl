	abstract = {Little has been done in the study of these intriguing questions,
	            and I do not wish to give the impression that any extensive set
	            of ideas exists that could be called a "theory." What is quite
	            surprising, as far as the histories of science and philosophy are
	            concerned, is that the major impetus for the fantastic growth of
	            interest in brain processes, both psychological and physiological
	            , has come from a device, a machine, the digital computer. In
	            dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the
	            luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and
	            incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must
	            meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and
	            absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human
	            mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity,
	            uncertainty, and irrationality, then we could use computers a
	            million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this
	            fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field
	            of neurophysiology. The more we study the information-processing
	            aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become.
	            It will be a very long time before we understand these processes
	            sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician
	            sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens
	            of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his
	            heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will
	            never be bored. What more can he ask?},
