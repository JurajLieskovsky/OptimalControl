# Continuous-Time Infinite-Horizon Linear-Quadratic Regulator

For a linear time-variant continuous-time system
$$
\dot{x}(t) = \underbrace{A(t) x(t) + B(t) u(t)}_{f(x(t), u(t), t)}
$$
and a quadratic total cost
$$
J(x(t_0),u(\tau),t_0) = \underbrace{x(t_f)^\top Q_f \, x(t_f)}_{\Phi(x_N)} + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \underbrace{x(\tau)^\top Q \, x(\tau) + u(\tau)^\top R \, u(\tau)}_{l(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau)} \, d\tau,
$$
where $Q_f \succeq 0$, $Q \succeq 0$, and $R \succ 0$, of its trajectory $(x(\tau), u(\tau))$, $\tau \in \langle t_0,t_f\rangle$ the optimal controller can be derived based on the assumption that the value function takes the form
$$
V(x(t),t) = x(t)^\top S(t) \, x(t), \quad S(t) \succ 0.
$$
When substituted into the [Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation](HJB.md) along with the system's dynamics we attain
$$
\begin{gathered}
-x(t)^\top\! \dot{S}(t)\, x(t) = \\
\min_{u(t)} \left\{x(t)^\top Q \, x(t) + u(t)^\top R \, u(t) + 2 \, x(t)^\top S(t) \left(A(t) \, x(t) + B(t) \, u(t) \right) \right\}. \tag{1}
\end{gathered}
$$
To find the minimum, we may take the gradient of its argument (which is by design quadratic and convex) with respect to $u(t)$, set it to zero and find the solution (optimal control input)
$$
u^*(t) = -R^{-1} B(t)^\top S(t) \, x(t) .
$$

The input can then be substituted back into (1). As the equation must hold for all $x(t)$, through basic manipulations we then attain the *continuous-time differential Riccati equation (CDRE)*
$$
-\dot{S}(t) = Q - S(t) \, B(t)^\top R^{-1} B(t) \, S(t) + S(t) \, A(t) + A(t)^\top \! S(t) 
$$
for a finite horizon $t_f \in \mathbb{R}$. Supplemented with the boundary conditon $S(t_f) = Q_f$, the CDRE forms a initial value problem (IVP) which can be solved using numerical integration. Numerical errors in the integration process may lead to the loss of positive-semi-definiteness. To overcome this, instead of integrating $S(t)$ directly, we may use its factorized form $S(t) = P(t) \, P^\top\!(t)$ a.k.a. the "square-root form" where
$$
-\dot{P}(t) = \frac{1}{2} Q \, {P^{-\!\top}\!(t)} - \frac{1}{2} {S(t)} \, B(t) \, R^{-1} B(t)^\top \! {P(t)} + A(t)^\top \! {P(t)}.
$$
As $P(t)$ must be invertible $Q_f$ must be (at least numerically) positive definite. Consequenlty we may use the cholesky factorization in order to form the boundary condition
$$
P(t_f) = L, \quad Q_f = L \, L^\top.
$$
